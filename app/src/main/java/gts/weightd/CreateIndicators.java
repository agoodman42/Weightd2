        Use this stack overflow page to continue your work. Next steps are to create indicators and
        a) figure out how to store them as persistent data
        and
        b) figure out how to pass them from activity to activity.

        you're also going to need to figure out how to create a list view and then take the
        results of this activity and add to an array which will populate that list-view.
